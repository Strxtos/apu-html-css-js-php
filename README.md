# HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP Training Sessions
>**Warning**
The session is currently ongoing, and the content may evolve as we delve deeper into the topic.

>**Warning**
Code samples in this repository have been used to teach HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. The main purpose of these samples is to demonstrate the features of a specific language. Do not use these samples in your production code. Some of the samples may be incomplete as I may have asked learners to finish them.
